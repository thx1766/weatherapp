# weatherapp
This is based on following Sean Allen's course SwiftUI Fundamentals

I created a network service to get weather data from an open API, as one of the challenges at the end of the first app

challenges
1. Build model and refactor HStack with an array
2. Get real data from a weather API
3. Build a tabBar that shows multipel cities

progress:
1: sortof, no enum for weather type or image attached to it
TODO: enum for weather with associated image
2: basically implemented a network call already
TODO:
change network call info to put in different cities
3: tabview of cities
TODO: all of it
start by hardcoding 5 cities
Eastampton
Ithaca
Tifton
